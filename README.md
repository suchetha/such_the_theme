# Such the Geek Theme
## Introduction
This theme is intended to be a base and basic theme to be used in [Drupal](http://drupal.org) 8.0 onwards. I created this because I was getting tired of creating sub-themes of basethemes that were using far too many files and becoming more complicated than I wanted them to be.

Of course now that this is done, I *too* seem to have far too many files. I'm sorry I've doubted you guys. But I have come this far, I may as well go the rest (as the actress said to the bishop).

## Sub-Theming
You don't need to sub-theme this. I'll be creating a mirror of this in the sub-theme directory that you can use without too many issues. Just put a credit to me in your own README file (or not, but doing is nicer) and  we'll call it square.

## Acknowledgements
- The guys at [Adaptive Theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/adaptivetheme) for their excellent work. You will find that [menu--main.html.twig](temmplates/navigation/menu--main.html.twig) is a complete ripoff from you, and I thank you very much for the work. I tried to change it and tweak it, but I found you can't improve perfection
- [Dries Buytaert](https://dri.es/) for Drupal. I wish I had found it sooner. My life would have been so much easier.
